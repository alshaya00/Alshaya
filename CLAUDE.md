# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance for AI assistants working with this repository.

## Repository Overview

- **Name**: me
- **Owner**: alshaya00
- **Type**: Personal project repository
- **Status**: New/Empty - ready for initial development

## Project Structure

```
me/
├── CLAUDE.md          # AI assistant guidance (this file)
└── (awaiting initial project setup)
```

As this repository grows, update this section to reflect the actual structure.

## Development Workflow

### Git Conventions

- **Main branch**: Use `main` as the primary branch
- **Feature branches**: Use descriptive names like `feature/add-feature-name`
- **Commit messages**: Write clear, concise commit messages in imperative mood
  - Good: "Add user authentication module"
  - Bad: "Added stuff" or "changes"

### Branch Strategy

1. Create feature branches from `main`
2. Make atomic commits with clear messages
3. Push changes and create pull requests for review
4. Merge via pull request after review

## Code Conventions

### General Guidelines

- Write clean, readable, self-documenting code
- Follow language-specific best practices for whatever language is used
- Keep functions/methods small and focused on a single responsibility
- Add comments only when the code's intent isn't obvious

### File Organization

- Group related files in logical directories
- Use consistent naming conventions:
  - `kebab-case` for file names
  - `PascalCase` for classes/components
  - `camelCase` for variables and functions

## For AI Assistants

### When Working on This Repository

1. **Read before modifying**: Always read existing code before making changes
2. **Maintain consistency**: Follow established patterns in the codebase
3. **Minimal changes**: Only make changes that are directly requested
4. **Test changes**: Verify changes work before committing
5. **Clear commits**: Write descriptive commit messages

### Project-Specific Notes

- This is a personal repository - conventions may be flexible
- When in doubt, ask for clarification on project preferences
- Update this CLAUDE.md file as the project evolves
